"They don't make movies like they used to" - yeah, they literally don't.

Before the pandemic, the movie theater industry saw steady growth and produced films of various genres and budgets. 
Since the pandemic, consumers have become much more selective on which films they watch in the theater. 
This is due to several reasons - one of the most notable is the introduction of the cultural and corporate shift to streaming services. 
Now, the most successful films are blockbuster movie theater experiences. This has resulted in distributors making less mid-budget comedies, dramas, rom-coms, thrillers, etc. 
The industry is now mostly saturated with films that are risk-adverse with high probabilites of having an optimal ROI - sequels, prequels, superhero films, major franchises.

Another major reason for more selective movie-going from consumers is the experienced inflation across several other facets of a consumers life, such as increased rent/mortgage prices, groceries, vehicles, with stagnant wages. 
Theaters are not a necessity and are a form of entertainment.

A few items to point out on the slides:

1) The pandemic had an astronomical impact as you can easily see the dip in 2020. 
Also, see the highest-grossing movie from each year - Barbie (2023) is the first movie since Frozen (2012) to be based on "original" IP.

2) Mid-budget films are capturing less revenue of the total box office, each year. 
The count of mid-budget films are decreasing at a higher rate than the others, and the total count of profitable* mid-budget films since 2019 is 0.
*profit is calculated by revenue - (budget*2). This is a universal calculation to consider marketing costs, licensing costs, and revenue splitting.

3) A few examples of the unhealthy market distribution where a couple films completely dominated the industry for that year

4) A fun, simple visual to show the Top 20 movies of all time, 13 of the 20 are owned by Disney and are identified by the *, and almost all the movies are a sequel or part of a larger franchise.
